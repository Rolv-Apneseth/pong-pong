# pong-pong
 Simple game made with pygame, heavily inspired by the classic game Pong.

To run the game, execute the main.py script.

Made for 2 players, controlling one "paddle" each. Player 1 moves using A and D, player 2 using left and right arrow keys.
Either player can also spawn a new ball by hitting the spacebar, although the ball will move in a random direction.
Spawning of balls is on a 2 second cooldown so that they can't be spammed. Note that balls do not have collisions with each other.

Players score points when a ball hits the other players goal.
